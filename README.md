I AM USING 1 DAY TOKEN FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT SINCE IT IS ONE DAY LATE.

I am submitting my assignment a few hour late, but I believed I have
implemented the scrabble word game correctly. The words when placed on the
row are slightly off, but should still work at intended. The next word
button moves onto to the next round and, resets button
resets the whole game. Everytime next word is pressed, score is being kept
tracked of the tile number, letter score, and word score.
